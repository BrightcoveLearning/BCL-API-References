# APIDOC - Deploy Reference to Public Docs

**Note: this page applies to Learning Services only.**

I've created a shell script that regerates docs for both the ...api and ...api-dev-docs srcs, and copies the results for the dev-docs version into the appropriate folder in BCL-developer-docs

## Steps

1. Open the BCL-API-References directory in terminal
2. Run: bash generate-docs.sh
3. If you see no errors, commit changes to both BCL-API-References and BCL-developer-docs
