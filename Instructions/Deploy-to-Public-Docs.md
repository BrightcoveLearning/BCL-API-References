# APIDOC - Deploy Reference to Public Docs

**Note: this page applies to Learning Services only.**

Without significant modifications to the APIDOC template, API references have to be embedded in the docs via iframes. I've worked out

## Steps

1. In Finder, go to the **BCL-developer-docs/.../references/versions/v1/** folder for the API
2. Rename the existing `index.html` file: `index-apiary.html`
3. Sync the **BCL-API-References/...-api-dev-docs/v1/doc** folder with the appropriate **BCL-developer-docs/.../references/versions/v1** folder (BCL-API-References should always have the latest version)
4. Be sure you sync from the ...api-dev-docs version!
