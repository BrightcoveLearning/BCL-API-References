# APIDOC - Writing the APIDOC Comments

**Note: Since we are not running APIDOC on the actual API code files, the APIDOC comments are independent of the language used to create the API. It is recommended that you use `.js` files in all cases, but that is not required. See the [APIDOC Reference](http://apidocjs.com/) for information on the structure of comments in other languages. These instructions assume you will use JavaScript comments.**

You can use as many or as few `.js` files for the comments as you wish.
